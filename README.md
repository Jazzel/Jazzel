# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammad Jazzel Mehmood — aka [JAZZ](https://www.jazzelmehmood.com/)

## 🧠 Researcher | Full Stack & Blockchain Developer | Systems Engineer

I'm a Computer Engineering graduate passionate about decentralized technologies, peer-to-peer systems, and building secure, scalable solutions at the intersection of Web3 and real-world infrastructure.

### 🔬 Ongoing Research

I'm currently working on a hybrid **Blockchain + SOME SPECIAL INGREDIENT** system that allows the formation of **offline-first peer-to-peer networks** where each node acts as a seeder. The aim is to:

- Enable resilient, infrastructure-less communication and data exchange
- Power **offline DeFi** and micro-transactions in disconnected areas
- Build robust fallback systems for emergencies or censorship-heavy regions

### 💻 Technical Interests

- P2P Networking & Blockchain Protocols
- Distributed Systems & Decentralized Applications (dApps)
- Offline-first Web3 Architecture
- Secure Authentication & Identity in DeFi
